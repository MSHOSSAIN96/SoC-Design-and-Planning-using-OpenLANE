# SoC-Design-and-Planning-using-OpenLANE
A project based on an ASIC design's entire RTL to GDSII flow. RISC-V design (picorv32a) + open-process (google+skywater130nm) + open-lane EDA tools (efabless) are now all open-source.
Beginning with fundamental ideas and moving through useful labs, this project provides a thorough exploration of the ASIC design process using OpenLANE and Sky130. It is constructed with open-source libraries and industry-standard EDA tools, giving users practical experience with IC design.

**Scope of work:**

I make sure users are prepared to follow the structured roadmap by outlining the prerequisites and installation procedures before they begin. The first element of the project, Theory, covers the basics of IC design, including nomenclature, components, and an outline of what distinguishes a good floorplan from a bad one. In this part, placement basics and library cells are also covered.

I explore the methods and factors needed for efficient signal routing in IC designs in the Routing section. A number of labs are included in the project to foster familiarity and practical skills.

In order to help users become accustomed to the environment, 
Lab 1 introduces them to the OpenLANE EDA tools.

Lab 2 demonstrates how to use OpenLANE for floorplanning and placement.

Lab 3 demonstrates the complexities of fundamental logic gates through inverter characterisation using the Sky130 model files.

Pre-layout timing analysis is covered in Lab 4, which also emphasizes the significance of a well-designed clock tree.

Lastly, Lab 5 walks users through the last stages to produce a GDSII file, which results in a comprehensive, production-ready layout of the IC design.

The goal of this roadmap is to equip users with the theoretical and practical knowledge they need to comprehend and carry out the entire IC design workflow, from theory to GDSII creation.

**Concerning the project:**
Using the OpenLane ASIC pipeline, we will examine how to create an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) to the Graphical Data System (GDS) file. Starting with an RTL file and ending with a GDS file, the procedure comprises several crucial stages.
