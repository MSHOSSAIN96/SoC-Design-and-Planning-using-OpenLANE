# SoC-Design-and-Planning-using-OpenLANE
A project based on an ASIC design's entire RTL to GDSII flow. RISC-V design (picorv32a) + open-process (google+skywater130nm) + open-lane EDA tools (efabless) are now all open-source.
Beginning with fundamental ideas and moving through useful labs, this project provides a thorough exploration of the ASIC design process using OpenLANE and Sky130. It is constructed with open-source libraries and industry-standard EDA tools, giving users practical experience with IC design.

I make sure users are prepared to follow the structured roadmap by outlining the prerequisites and installation procedures before they begin. The first element of the project, Theory, covers the basics of IC design, including nomenclature, components, and an outline of what distinguishes a good floorplan from a bad one. In this part, placement basics and library cells are also covered.

I explore the methods and factors needed for efficient signal routing in IC designs in the Routing section. A number of labs are included in the project to foster familiarity and practical skills.
